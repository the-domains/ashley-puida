![It's hard to believe it's been two weeks already since I earned my #IFBB #pro status. A lot has changed in those two weeks. I think there's a lot more of it around the corner too. @teamnjff coach Norm and I start training for my pro debut @spectrumfitnessproductions #sacpro2015 on Monday. I'm nervous about this show you guys but I'm going to work hard and bring the best package I've had yet to the stage.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f2544ae09eea31541321de967969c8342e14255d.jpg)
